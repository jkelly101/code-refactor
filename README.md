# Code Refactor

For this project I was tasked with refactoring an existing website’s code to meet accessibility standards and optimize it for search engines.

## Motivation

To improve the existing code without changing the function and making the website accessible to avoid litigation.

## Improvements

To make the site accessible, I added alt tags to each of the images along with a short description of the image. I also replaced the existing elements with semantic elements to make the code more accessible and easier to follow.

### Cleaned code:
1. Fixed broken links
2. Added page title
3. Removed superfluous tags and classes from HTML and CSS sheets
4. Adjusted mislabeled id and class tags.
5. Reorganized CSS so that styles were grouped together by section.
6. Consolidated identical styles under one class instead of multiple classes with the same style rules.
