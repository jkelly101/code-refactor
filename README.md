# Code Refactor

For this project I was tasked with refactoring an existing websiteâ€™s code to meet accessibility standards and optimize it for search engines.

## Motivation

To improve the existing code without changing the function and making the website accessible to avoid litigation.

## Improvements

To make the site accessible, I added alt attributes to each of the images along with a short description. I also replaced the existing elements with semantic elements to make the code more accessible and easier to follow.

### Cleaned code:
1. Fixed broken links.
2. Added page title.
3. Removed superfluous selectors from CSS sheets
4. Adjusted mislabeled id and class attributes.
5. Reorganized CSS so that styles were grouped together by section.
6. Consolidated identical styles under one selector instead of multiple with the same style rules.
